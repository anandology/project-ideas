# Logo Sketchpad

An online interactive environment to write and share programs in the [LOGO programming language][1].

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)

Logo is a simple propramming language with commands to move a turtle holding a pen on the screen to create beautiful drawings. Logo deserves more visibility and presence on web.

This project reduces the barrier to program in Logo and inspire others by making it easier to share interesting logo programs (sketches).

# Features

* Live programming environment
* Profile for every user (like github)
* The profile page showcases the current sketches
* Ability to fork a sketch and make changes

# Requirements

* Make the system flexible to support other languages in the future

# Inspiration

* https://www.calormen.com/jslogo/
* https://openprocessing.org/

The jslogo project brings Logo to the web, but it need lot more work to make it widely usable. The openprocessing.org is a good model to study and emulate.

# License

The Logo intereter will be MIT licensed and the platform will be AGPL v3.
